## Key Design Decisions

### 🎨 User Experience
- **Instagram-like interactions** with pregnancy-specific optimizations
- **Double-tap reactions** with haptic feedback and immediate response
- **Emoji reaction system** extended from current 7 to 9 pregnancy-focused reactions
- **Milestone integration** as highlighted posts rather than separate components
- **Clean design** following existing sophisticated minimalism with blush-rose, sage-green palette

### ⚡ Performance Architecture  
- **< 200ms perceived response** through optimistic updates and local state management
- **Real-time features** via WebSocket with Server-Sent Events fallback
- **Multi-level caching** strategy (browser → Redis → CDN)
- **Virtual scrolling** for large feed performance
- **Offline support** with intelligent background sync

### 🏗️ Technical Strategy
- **Builds on existing architecture** rather than replacing sophisticated current system
- **Enhances current models** (Post, Reaction, Comment) with strategic additions
- **Preserves family warmth** and memory book features while improving UX
- **Maintains data integrity** with comprehensive validation and error handling
