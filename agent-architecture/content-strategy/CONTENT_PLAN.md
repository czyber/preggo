# Pregnancy Content Strategy & Architecture
*Level 1 Strategy Document - Content Strategy Director*

## Executive Summary

This strategy transforms pregnancy content from information delivery into **emotional companionship** - creating a comprehensive content system that provides meaningful, stage-appropriate support while fostering family connection. The content architecture integrates seamlessly with the redesigned feed experience to offer personalized, gentle guidance throughout the pregnancy journey.

## Content Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Companionship Over Information**
Content feels like advice from a caring, knowledgeable friend who understands the pregnancy journey - warm, personal, and emotionally intelligent.

**2. Progressive Disclosure**
Information unfolds naturally as needed, preventing overwhelm while ensuring critical guidance is always accessible.

**3. Celebration-Focused**
Every stage of pregnancy is celebrated, normalized, and supported - acknowledging both joys and challenges without judgment.

**4. Family-Inclusive**
Content considers the entire family unit, providing guidance for partners, extended family, and support circles.

**5. Culturally Sensitive**
Respectful of diverse family structures, traditions, and personal choices throughout the pregnancy journey.
