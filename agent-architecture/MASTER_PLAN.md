# Preggo App Overhaul Master Plan
*Chief Engineer Architecture Document*

## Project Mission
Transform the Preggo app into a minimalistic, warm, and supportive mobile-first pregnancy companion that provides meaningful content and fosters family connection.

## Core Principles
1. **Mobile-First Design**: Every component optimized for mobile screens
2. **Minimalistic Warmth**: Clean design with emotional depth
3. **Content Excellence**: High-quality, pregnancy-stage-appropriate content
4. **Performance First**: Fast, smooth, accessible experience

## Agent Hierarchy

### Level 1: Strategy Agents (Reporting to Chief Engineer)

#### 1. Feed Experience Architect
**Mission**: Redesign the feed to be minimalistic, warm, and mobile-first
**Deliverables**: 
- `feed-redesign/STRATEGY.md` - Complete redesign strategy
- `feed-redesign/COMPONENTS.md` - Component breakdown
- `feed-redesign/MOBILE_PATTERNS.md` - Mobile interaction patterns

#### 2. Content Strategy Director  
**Mission**: Create comprehensive pregnancy content system
**Deliverables**:
- `content-strategy/CONTENT_PLAN.md` - Content architecture
- `content-strategy/WEEKLY_TIPS.md` - Week-by-week tips structure
- `content-strategy/BABY_DEVELOPMENT.md` - Baby development content

#### 3. Implementation Orchestrator
**Mission**: Coordinate implementation across frontend and backend
**Deliverables**:
- `implementation/ROADMAP.md` - Implementation timeline
- `implementation/DEPENDENCIES.md` - Technical dependencies
- `implementation/TESTING_PLAN.md` - Quality assurance strategy

### Level 2: Planning Agents (Deployed by Strategy Agents)

Each Strategy Agent will deploy planning sub-agents to detail their areas:

#### Feed Planning Agents:
- **Component Designer**: Detail each feed component
- **Animation Planner**: Define subtle, meaningful animations
- **Mobile UX Specialist**: Optimize touch interactions

#### Content Planning Agents:
- **Medical Content Researcher**: Accurate pregnancy information
- **Emotional Support Writer**: Supportive messaging
- **Visual Content Planner**: Size comparisons, infographics

#### Technical Planning Agents:
- **API Designer**: Backend structure for new features
- **Database Architect**: Content storage optimization
- **Performance Optimizer**: Speed and efficiency planning

### Level 3: Implementation Agents (Deployed by Planning Agents)

Implementation agents will execute the plans created by planning agents.

```

### Inter-Agent Communication
- Agents communicate via markdown files in their designated directories
- Each agent must document decisions, rationale, and dependencies
- Implementation agents read from planning documents
- Progress updates in `progress/` directories

## Design Constraints

### From Design Tokens (specs/DESIGN_TOKENS.md):
- **Primary Colors**: Soft Pink (#F8BBD0), Muted Lavender (#E1BEE7), Gentle Mint (#B2DFDB)
- **Typography**: Playwrite Perú (logo), Poppins (primary), Roboto (body)

- **Icons**: Soft, rounded, nature-inspired

### Mobile-First Requirements:
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Bottom sheet patterns for actions
- Thumb-friendly interaction zones
- Progressive disclosure of information

## Content Requirements

### Weekly Tips System:
- Tips for each week of pregnancy (weeks 1-42)
- Categories: Health, Preparation, Emotional, Partner Tips
- Personalized based on pregnancy stage

### Baby Development Content:
- Weekly size comparisons (fun, relatable objects)
- Development milestones
- Visual representations
- Scientific accuracy with warmth

### Family Engagement:
- Prompts for family interaction
- Celebration moments

   - Reduced cognitive load
   - Increased engagement time
   - Higher family participation

2. **Content Quality**:
   - Medical accuracy verification
   - User satisfaction scores
   - Content relevance ratings

3. **Technical Performance**:
   - Load time improvements
   - Reduced bundle size
   - API response times

## Agent Deployment Sequence

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy all Level 1 Strategy Agents simultaneously
2. **Phase 2**: Strategy Agents create their plans (2 hours)
3. **Phase 3**: Deploy Level 2 Planning Agents based on strategies
4. **Phase 4**: Planning Agents detail implementation (2 hours)
5. **Phase 5**: Deploy Level 3 Implementation Agents
6. **Phase 6**: Implementation and testing
7. **Phase 7**: Integration and refinement

## Notes for Sub-Agents

- **Quality over Speed**: Take time to think deeply
- **User-Centric**: Every decision should benefit pregnant users and their families
- **Collaboration**: Read other agents' work to ensure consistency
- **Documentation**: Over-communicate in your markdown files
- **Innovation**: Propose creative solutions within constraints
